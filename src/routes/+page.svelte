				Hello, I'm Blake Sim, a detail-oriented and dedicated professional with 3 years of hands-on
				experience in web development. My journey began with 2 years of focused frontend work and
				expanded to encompass 1 year of full-stack development.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my previous roles, I specialized in planning and implementing the prototypes of
				back-office web applications. I thrive on delving deep into the intricacies of business
				logic, learning to speak the language of various domains, and effectively collaborating with
				developers, designers, and managers. My toolkit primarily includes JavaScript, TypeScript,
				React, and Next.js as my mainstay technologies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, I've ventured into server-side technologies to gain a broader perspective on
				web development. But it's not just about the code for me. My true aspiration lies in
				understanding user behaviors to create applications that are not only user-friendly but also
				practical. I believe that by putting users at the center of my development process, I can
				craft solutions that truly resonate with their needs.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm enthusiastic about taking on new challenges and continually expanding my skill set to
				deliver innovative, user-centric web applications. Let's connect and explore opportunities
				to collaborate!
			</p>
